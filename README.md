# Project Title - Validation of data fusion and control blocks of AD systems

## Project Overview
This project focuses on validating the algorithms of Autonomous Driving (AD) Systems software, with an emphasis on sensor fusion modules (LIDAR, GPS, IMU, Cameras), control blocks, and sensor data integration. The validation process is carried out through a combination of simulation tests and real-world data integration. The goal is to ensure the robustness and accuracy of the system, continuously improving its performance based on the results. The project also includes comprehensive documentation to support the validation methodology, test cases, and results.
